## Mass Email Volunteers
As a volunteer manager, I can quickly email a list of volunteers. 

This may be volunteers associated with an activity. Example: "The door code to the main office has changed ..."

This may be volunteers associated with a shift. Example: "We're expecting rain on Tuesday, so please bring appropriate gear to the park with you."

This may be volunteers for a given position. Example: "We're looking for trained dog walkers to help with our adoption event next month."

These may be recurring messages that make sense as a template, but many of them will be ad hoc. For MVP, having a way to send ad hoc messages quickly is more important than having nicely formatted templated messages.

## Volunteer Recurrence
As a volunteer manager, I need a way to assign recurring volunteers to an ongoing series of shifts. Example: "Carol Smith walks dogs every Tuesday at 3 p.m."

### V4S Volunteer Recurrence Schedule

## Shift Recurrence
As a volunteer manager, I need a way to set up recurring shifts. Example: "I need 3-5 people to walk dogs at 3 p.m. every Tuesday."

This is a much nicer way of accomplishing the same goal. Use this as a starting point.
